<h3>Summary</h3>

I wanted to practice my skills and wanted to make a simple full stack application. I also had this idea of just gathering people's preferred choices when it came to things that we use or consume almost everyday. I decided to build this App using React + Redux for the frontend and Node & express for the backend. I chose MongoDB to store the data collected from the user.

I enjoyed building this App because, after completing it, it gave me confidence to continue to learn more and grow as a developer.
